1,2,"Agentic AI: The Future of Intelligent Automation  What is Agentic AI? Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can operate autonomously, make decisions, and take actions based on objectives without constant human intervention. These AI agents can interact with their environment, learn from experiences, and adapt to new situations.   Key Features of Agentic AI: ✅ Autonomy – Can function independently ✅ Goal-Oriented – Works toward specific objectives ✅ Adaptive Learning – Improves over time ✅ Decision-Making – Evaluates options and takes action   Why is Agentic AI Important? From automating workflows to creating self-learning systems, Agentic AI is shaping the future of industries like e-commerce, customer support, finance, and healthcare. It enables businesses to operate more efficiently and innovate faster.",Imran Hassan,9,2,0,19 hours ago,"agentic ai the future of intelligent automation what is agentic ai? agentic ai refers to artificial intelligence systems that can operate autonomously, make decisions, and take actions based on objectives without constant human intervention. these ai agents can interact with their environment, learn from experiences, and adapt to new situations. key features of agentic ai autonomy can function independently goal-oriented works toward specific objectives adaptive learning improves over time decision-making evaluates options and takes action why is agentic ai important? from automating workflows to creating self-learning systems, agentic ai is shaping the future of industries like e-commerce, customer support, finance, and healthcare. it enables businesses to operate more efficiently and innovate faster."

4,5,"""From search to scenario analysis"" — how I automated an entire Finland Electricity Market Intelligence workflow using Agentic AI + MCP servers in couple of days using 48 different tools!!! Sounds impossible??? lets find out :)  There's a growing buzz around Model Context Protocol (MCP) – but what is it, and how is it transforming the world of LLMs and agentic AI? At its core, MCP (Model Context Protocol) is changing the way AI agents interact with tools by offering a universal standard. Instead of hardcoding integrations, MCP servers enable AI agents to autonomously discover and use tools seamlessly and securely.  I recently put this into practice by building a fully automated Market Intelligence & Financial Impact Report generator focused on the Finnish electricity market all using an MCP-driven agentic architecture with Claude.  Here's what I set out to automate: ✅ Real-time web data gathering ✅ Extraction of internal/local files ✅ Automated scraping of regulatory & market data from official websites ✅ Scenario & sensitivity analysis using sequential thinking ✅ Fully formatted report creation + database logging  How I did it along with video demo - refer to the below article.  ⚠️ Disclaimer: This use case was primarily designed to explore MCP server integration capabilities. I have not validated the quality or business-readiness of the tool outputs yet. The focus here is on showcasing the MCP integration with AI.",Prasanna Pandian,1,0,0,3 minutes ago,"from search to scenario analysis how i automated an entire finland electricity market intelligence workflow using agentic ai mcp servers in couple of days using 48 different tools!!! sounds impossible??? lets find out theres a growing buzz around model context protocol mcp but what is it, and how is it transforming the world of llms and agentic ai? at its core, mcp model context protocol is changing the way ai agents interact with tools by offering a universal standard. instead of hardcoding integrations, mcp servers enable ai agents to autonomously discover and use tools seamlessly and securely. i recently put this into practice by building a fully automated market intelligence financial impact report generator focused on the finnish electricity market all using an mcp-driven agentic architecture with claude. heres what i set out to automate real-time web data gathering extraction of internallocal files automated scraping of regulatory market data from official websites scenario sensitivity analysis using sequential thinking fully formatted report creation database logging how i did it along with video demo- refer to the below article. disclaimer this use case was primarily designed to explore mcp server integration capabilities. i have not validated the quality or business-readiness of the tool outputs yet. the focus here is on showcasing the mcp integration with ai."
