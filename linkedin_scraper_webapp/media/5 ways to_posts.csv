"Trying to be creative with a 9-5 schedule?  Creative teams can't work well under constant pressure and unrealistic urgency. They need the right environment to think, create, and stay productive.  Here are 5 ways to make that happen:  1: Let them work in their flow: If deadlines are met, don't micromanage.  2: Creativity needs space: While managing back-to-back tasks, take short breaks.  3: Skip the endless meetings:  ❌ Let's plan to plan things ✅ Just do it!  4: Stop switching between tasks: Focus on one project at a time.  5: Do rest as it's part of the job: Burnout drains creativity faster than anything!  How does your team balance creativity and productivity?",Muhammad Usama,7,0,0,22 hours ago
