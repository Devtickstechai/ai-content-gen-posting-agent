"Starting something new is always challenging. Whether it's learning Django, freelancing, or content creation, the biggest hurdle is often self-doubt.  A few months ago, I was just exploring Django, and every error felt overwhelming. But instead of quitting, I focused on small wins—solving one problem at a time. Today, I'm confident in my progress and excited to keep learning!  ✅ Learning something new? Break it down into small steps. ✅ Struggling with errors? They are part of the process. ✅ Feeling stuck? Keep going. Growth happens outside your comfort zone.  I’m still in the learning phase and improving every day. If you're on a similar journey, let's connect and grow together!",Syed Saddam Shah,3,0,0,13 hours ago
