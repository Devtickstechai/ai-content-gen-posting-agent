8 Must-Read Books on Data Engineering and MLOps for 2025,Raj Narayanan,39,3,0,5 hours ago
"Giving Back to the Community   Throughout my journey—from my bachelor’s to my master’s—I’ve relied heavily on online tutorials, research papers, and videos to navigate topics like Full Stack Engineering, Publishing Research Papers, and MLOps. Now, it’s time to give back!  I’ll be actively sharing insights, practical implementations, and lessons learned about MLOps and research methodologies here on LinkedIn. Whether you’re just starting out or already deep into the field, let’s learn and grow together!  If you’re interested in collaborating or contributing, feel free to DM me—always happy to connect and share knowledge!",Satyam Pathak,2,0,0,6 hours ago
