"Σ μ σ σ² X̄>   : The Unsung Hero of    &    <X̄ σ²σ μ Σ  Most people think AI is all about deep learning and fancy algorithms, but without statistics, AI wouldn't exist. From predictive analytics to neural networks, statistical principles power every stage of AI development.  Recently, I’ve been brushing up on my statistics skills to baseline for machine learning and AI applications. The deeper I dive, the more I realize how fundamental statistical concepts are in making AI models accurate, scalable, and efficient.  If you're working with AI, understanding statistics isn’t optional—it’s essential. Check out my latest article below to explore how statistics fuels the AI revolution.",Samir P.,5,2,0,21 hours ago
"With March Madness starting in less than 48 hours, I decided to build BracketBrain: an all in 1 site where users can use 3 different machine learning models to compare team play-styles, view side by side stats, get win probabilities, and try to get an edge on sportsbooks. It's completely free, and we already have over 1000 users, check it out here:  Github:",Ankit Devalla,124,23,1,12 hours ago
"I’m thrilled to share that my Final Year Project report on ""Used Mobile Phones Price Prediction for E-commerce Applications"" is now live!   Throughout this project, we tackled the challenge of inconsistent pricing in the second-hand mobile phone market by integrating machine learning and deep learning techniques. Using VGG16 for condition classification and XGBoost for price prediction, we built a Flutter-based mobile application that enables users to get real-time price estimates based on images and device specifications.   This journey has been an incredible learning experience—combining AI, software development, and real-world problem-solving. Huge thanks to my supervisor,, and everyone who supported us along the way!  Check out the full report here:  Would love to hear your thoughts! Let’s connect and discuss how AI can enhance e-commerce pricing strategies.",Muhammad Nasr,9,4,0,17 hours ago
